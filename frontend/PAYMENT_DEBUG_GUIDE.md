# Payment Form Debug Guide

This guide explains the issues found with the PaymentForm component and the fixes implemented.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Stripe Publishable Key
**Problem**: The `.env` file had an empty `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` value.
**Impact**: Stripe couldn't initialize properly, causing the PaymentForm to fail silently.
**Fix**: Added a test key and proper error handling.

### 2. No Error Handling for Stripe Loading
**Problem**: No error handling when Stripe fails to load.
**Impact**: Users would see a blank dialog with no feedback.
**Fix**: Added error boundary and loading state handling.

### 3. Dialog Content Styling Issues
**Problem**: Dialog had `p: 0` padding which could cause rendering issues.
**Impact**: PaymentForm might not display properly inside the dialog.
**Fix**: Added proper overflow handling and styling.

### 4. Missing Conditional Rendering
**Problem**: PaymentForm relied on `bookingId &&` but didn't handle null case properly.
**Impact**: Could cause rendering issues when bookingId is null.
**Fix**: Added explicit null checking with error message.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `/src/services/stripe.ts`
- Added proper Stripe key validation
- Added console warnings for missing keys
- Improved error handling

### 2. Enhanced `/src/components/payments/PaymentForm.tsx`
- Added error boundary for Stripe loading failures
- Added debug logging to track component state
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Removed conflicting box-shadow in dialog context

### 3. Improved `/src/pages/Checkout.tsx`
- Enhanced dialog styling for better overflow handling
- Added explicit null checking for bookingId
- Improved error feedback for missing booking data

### 4. Created Debug Tools
- Added `/src/pages/PaymentDebug.tsx` for isolated testing
- Added route at `/payment-debug` for easy access

## Testing the Fix

### Method 1: Use the Debug Page
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/payment-debug`
2. Click "Open Payment Form"
3. Verify the PaymentForm renders properly

### Method 2: Test the Actual Checkout Flow
1. Go through the normal booking process
2. Click "Complete Payment" on the checkout page
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Verify the PaymentForm appears in the dialog

## Environment Setup

Make sure your `.env` file has a valid Stripe publishable key:

```env
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_stripe_key_here
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to load Stripe" error
**Solution**: Check that VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY is set in your .env file

### Issue: Dialog opens but PaymentForm is blank
**Solution**: Check browser console for Stripe-related errors

### Issue: PaymentForm renders but card input doesn't work
**Solution**: Verify Stripe key is valid and Elements wrapper is working

### Issue: Network errors when creating payment intent
**Solution**: Ensure backend payment API endpoints are running and accessible

## Browser Console Debugging

Look for these console messages:
- "PaymentFormInner mounted:" - Confirms component is rendering
- "⚠️ Stripe publishable key not found" - Indicates missing Stripe key
- Any Stripe-related errors during loading

## Next Steps

1. Replace the test Stripe key with your actual publishable key
2. Test payment flow end-to-end with test card numbers
3. Verify backend payment API endpoints are working
4. Remove debug logging in production builds
