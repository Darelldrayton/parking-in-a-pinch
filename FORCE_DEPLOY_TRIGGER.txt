DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER - TIMESTAMP: 2024-12-23 20:00:00 PST

This file forces a rebuild and deployment.

âœ… Latest changes that should be live:
- /ruler routes implemented in App.tsx (login, dashboard, cleanup-listings)
- Homepage rocket emoji added for visual confirmation  
- Navigation version updated to v2.2 - Ruler Routes Active
- Enhanced console logging with deployment timestamps
- Problematic nested Git structure cleaned up

ðŸŽ¯ Test Routes:
- /ruler/login â†’ AdminLogin component
- /ruler/dashboard â†’ AdminDashboard component  
- /ruler/cleanup-listings â†’ CleanupListings component

If you're reading this on the live site, deployment is working.
If /ruler routes still redirect to home, there's a caching issue.

TEST DEPLOYMENT: RULER_ROUTES_ACTIVE_v2.2
